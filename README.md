# EasyFetch - an alternative dashboard for ESPeasy

EasyFetch is an alternative dashboard in Tile Optic for ESPEasy (https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy). It was created to have a quick and relatively simple way of visualising data and interacting with the hardware (buttons & sliders) in a browser. Especially where no bigger infrastructure like a home automation server is needed (the ability to write complex rules in ESPEasy and the ability of communication between the nodes via a simple P2P network can often make a full-blown home automation system unnecessary).

> **!!! ATTENTION: The following manual doesn't work anymore for recent versions of EasyFetch !!!**  
> **!!! Renaming device— or valuenames is not necessary anymore !!!**
>
> The short updated manual for customising your dashboard:
>
> **On desktop:**  
> Right-click on any tile: enters the "edit-mode" and opens the context menu.  
> Left-click outside the tiles: applies changes without saving.  
> Left-click on the "×︎" at the bottom of the screen: closes the "edit-mode" without saving!
>
> **Smartphone:**  
> Long-press on "☰︎" at the bottom of the screen: enters the "edit-mode"  
> Longer touch on tile: opens context menu.  
> Touch somewhere else: applies changes without saving.

***
## Overview:
The Dashboard consists of different elements with different purposes:

  1. **main-section:** the tasks you have in espeasy are rendered here in tiles. There are a lot of options to customize these.
There are 3 possible categories: 
     1. big-values
     2. slider
     3. the rest: buttons and "ordinary" tiles
	 4. charts

  2. **unit-menu:** Here are all the units listed, that are connected via the controller called ESPEasy P2P Networking (https://espeasy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Controller/C013.html)
     * Next to the unit name is the unit number.
     * The symbol "⊙" leading the unit name marks the unit which contains the EasyFetch file.

  3. **unit-name:** The unit-name of the unit that is actually selected. Next to it is the signal strength in dBm of this unit.
     * Clicking it enters full-screen mode on supported browsers

4. **Menu and Split View Buttons:**

* The left button opens the unit list.
* The right button opens the devices page of the ESPEasy unit in a split view (on smartphones, it overlays the page instead due to limited space). If long-clicked, this button leaves EasyFetch and directs to the tools page of the selected unit.

## Installing Fetch:

1. Download the [fetch.html.gz](https://github.com/chromoxdor/EasyFetch/raw/refs/heads/main/fetch.html.gz) file to your computer. Alternatively, you can rename it to index.htm.gz to replace the main page.

2. Open your browser and navigate to http://<ESP_DEVICE_IP>. Replace <ESP_DEVICE_IP> with your device’s Local IP Address.

3. Click on the „Tools“ tab.

4. Select the „Filesystem->File browser“ button.

5. Click the „Upload“ button.

6. Click the „Browse…“ button and select the fetch.html file.

7. Click the „Upload“ button again.

Now, open your browser and view the new dashboard at http://<ESP_DEVICE_IP>/fetch.html.gz. You should now see all the ESPEasy device tasks and states.

(Note: If you have multiple ESPEasy devices in a network, you’ll need only one device with the fetch.html.gz file as the primary device when all devices communicate via the p2p controller. ESPEasy P2P Networking must be added in /Controllers. For more information, see https://espeasy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Controller/C013.html?highlight=p2p.)


### Display options:
***
**1. Ordinary Tile:**

- Each task is presented as a tile, organised by its task number.
- The upper left corner of each tile displays the task name. If the task has associated values, they are aligned right and displayed below the task name.
- These tiles and the buttons associated with them can be clicked and long-clicked, triggering events that can be accessed in rules.
- Short clicks trigger events with the name `<taskname>event`, while long clicks trigger events with the name `<taskname>long`.
- Here’s an example of a rule:

```
on sensorevent do
    dosomething
endon
```

***

**2. Buttons:**
  - Buttons are basically ordinary tiles where the valuenames/values are not rendered
  - They have the ability to change their color depending on their state
     ![button simple](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33860956/159255555-d7caea8e-4913-4a4b-98b7-f9a83e5c4f3c.png)
     (the device here is a sonoff s20 and since we do not need the first button, since its the hardwarebutton, on our dahboard we can hide it with the "XX" option. the second button is the actual relay so the state changes depending on the gpio state)
     
    The rule for it:
 ```
  On buttonevent do
   gpiotoggle,12
  endon
```

 2. Name a dummy device something that consists "dButtons" and every value becomes a button. 
        - You can add an option for colorbuttons with "?C"(see picture below)
        - put "&\<unit_number>" to the end of the valuename to send this buttonevent to a specific device. (e.g. valuename "button&2" will result in this           command: `SendTo,2,"event,ButtonEvent"` or if longclicked `SendTo,2,"event,ButtonLong"`)
        - put "&A" to the end of the valuename and the event will be send to all connected nodes

         <img width="600" alt="b1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33860956/159254570-8156aadb-2216-4cc3-88fe-a43a4747743b.png">
         <img width="200" alt="b1f" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33860956/159254576-76b425bc-58c5-4e3e-9142-5b04a39bde3a.png">

  - Alert: whenever the value of “btnState” / “btnStateC” or any value in a "dButtons" task is 2 the tile becomes red.

**3. Slider**

 - Slider: there are two types of slider. The “ordinary” slider and the “time" slider
 - Every slider calls an event when finished sliding. (e.g. “sliderEvent”)
 - To create a slider name a dummy device either "vSlider", "nvSlider" or "tSlider"

    1. The ordinary slider: There are two versions too:

        1. The slider with values displayed: name a task something consisting of “vSlider” and every item will become a Slider with values shown while sliding

        2. The slider with values hidden: name a task something consisting of “nvSlider”

        - For both kinds of slider you can set a minimum, a maximum and the steps.
        - To achieve this add ?<minimum>?<maximum>?<steps> to the itemname (e.g. slider?0?100?0.1)
        - For the slider that shows values (vSlider) you can also add a unit of measurement if you set you personal range (e.g. slider?0?100?0.1?°C)

          Notice: if you use this you must use it altogether. Standard values if unset are min=0 max=1023 step=1.

          <img width="600" alt="vS1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33860956/159258001-6dcc11d5-e6cb-471e-b115-4cfb14c600e6.png">
         
         - If you add "Sw" to the Taskname (e.g. “vSliderSw” ), a "switch" function is added to the slider. If you click on the left 1/10th of the slider, the value becomes the set minimum (default=0) and if you click on   the right 1/10th, it becomes the maximum (default=1023)

   2. The "time" slider: Name a task something consisting of “tSlider” and every item will become a "time" slider. (Important! To make this work you need to set the number of decimals to 4)
      - The "time" slider stores the values of both times in one number. This makes it easier to store these values with the regulator - level 
        control plugin since only one plugin for both values is needed
      - This slider has two thumbs for two time values (e.g. on and off time). Both times are stored in the corresponding taskvalue. The code 
        example shows how to make use of it (for persistant storage of the values add the "level control" plugin):
      <pre><code>
       On System#Boot Do //retrieve the values after a power loss back from the "level control" plugin
          TaskValueSet,tslider,1,[timekeepXX#getlevel]/10000 
          Let,1,[tSlider#Time] 
          Let,2,[var#1]*10000-[var#1#F]*10000
       Endon

       On tSliderEvent do
          TimerSet,2,10 // after 10secs store the value in the "level control" plugin
          Let,1,[tSlider#Time]
          Let,2,[var#1]*10000-[var#1#F]*10000
       endon

       On Rules#Timer=2 Do
          config,task,timekeepXX,SetLevel,[tSlider#Time]*10000  //level stores only two digits so we make an integer 
       Endon

       On Clock#Time=All,**:** Do
          If %syssec_d%/60>=[var#1#F] And %syssec_d%/60<[var#2]
            GPIO,2,1
          Else
            GPIO,2,0
          Endif
       Endon
      </code></pre>

**4. Big values**

- Big values are displayed when the taskname consist of “bigVal” or if colored “bigValC” 
- You can call an item of a “bigVal” Task something that consists “clock”/”time”, “date”, “year” to get this displayed independent of the value. (german speaking persons can also use “uhr” / "zeit", “datum” -> for date format with dots and "jahr")

**5. Additional things**

 - Thingspeak: add a thingspeak value to display the last value of a field of a public thingspeak channel, use this scheme for a valuename: 
   "name&<channel>&<fieldnumber>" optional you can give it a unit of measurement with ?<unit of measurement> (like in every other field):

<img width="546" alt="ts2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33860956/159266771-29123c9b-0d32-4109-b681-566101caa433.png"><img width="143" alt="ts2f" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33860956/159266774-5fdb5ff3-9f60-49d4-a4dd-f4d5170afa5c.png">

 - Grid layout (desktop view): 
    - the amount of colums (1,2,3 or maximum 4) is determined by the ammount of tiles. 
      - 1 tile = one colum
      - 2 - 4 tiles = 2 colums 
      - 5 - 9 tiles = 3 colums
      - \> 9 tiles = 4 colums
    - The amount of "big values" however is prioritized for rendering the grid layout and constraints it.
      - e.g. if a 4 colum grid is preferred just create a dummy-device with 4 values and call it "bigVal"
        but if you only have 3 values to display you can add an empty "big value" tile by calling an valuename "noVal" or hide it with "XX"

    - with this "trick" you can have a 2 colum grid layout even wihout displaying any "big values":
